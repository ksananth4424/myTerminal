usage: mygrep [OPTION] PATTERN [FILE]...
PATTERN must contain only one word or words not separated by white spaces.

Options that myShell(mygrep) can perform are:
    1) -c print only a count of selected lines per FILE.
    2) -m stop after NUM selected lines.
    3) -n print line number with output lines.
    4) -s suppress error messages.
    5) -l print only names of FILEs with selected lines.
    6) -v Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.
    7) -L Suppress normal output; instead print the  name  of  each  input
          file from which no output would normally have been printed.
Syntax for mygrep with -m option is: mygrep -m [integer] PATTERN [FILE]...
